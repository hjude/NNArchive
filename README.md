# NNArchive

A Neural Network Archiver (NNArchive) is used to store and retrieve information from large databases, such as images or text documents. It uses a deep learning model that can be trained on the data stored in its database for faster retrieval of similar items later on. The NNArchive stores each item with an associated vector representation which allows it to quickly search through all entries using similarity measures and other algorithms like clustering, classification etc.,
NNArchive is used when there is a large amount of information that needs storing or searching in the future for quick retrieval purposes.

1. Train on data
2. Fine-tune to extract data in a ineluctable way

#To extract data from neural network archiver:

The process involves three steps - 1) Extracting the model, 2) Preparation and loading into a new environment (either Python or TensorFlow), followed by 3) Training. The first step is done using ArchiveR's command line interface which can be found here https://github.com/hjude/NNArchive
